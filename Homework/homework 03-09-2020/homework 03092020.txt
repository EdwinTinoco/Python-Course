Homework for the week of 3/9/2020:

Create a Virtual Wallet in Python

- A user should be able to interact with your wallet in the following ways:
  - Choices made in a menu screen
  - Check Balance
  - Withdrawal Cash
  - Deposit Cash
  - Go back to the main menu
  - Exit the Program

Try using OOP principles to build this program. I will be looking at how your control structures 
( the flow of your program, function routing, etc ) come together.

- Bonus
  - Attempt to use a Flask API to persist account information.

You have until Friday morning to get this finished. Help each other out, and good luck!
